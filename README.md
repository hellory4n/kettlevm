## more examples

```java
class Annihilator5000 {
    // that's not a pointer that's just a reference
    fun string* i_hope_you_die(Annihilator5000* this) {
        // reverse polish notation is easier to parse
        // .. from lua
        return "i hope " "you die" ..;
    }
}
```

```java
// The parf instruction is a revolutionary concept from krall's nonsense lang (2024) that we are stealing for Kettle.
// `parf;` directly maps to a parf instruction in the virtual machine
// The parf instruction simply prints "meow".
// Truly game-changing
class ParfInstruction {
    static fun ParfInstruction* new() {
        parf;
    }
}
```

Also there's `any*` and a cast operator `a as B` because i can't be bothered to make generics

## how to run

you need cmake c

scripts folder

there's only one dependency raylib the build script downloads raylib
